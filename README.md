# nickchat

**Currently very much a WIP**

A Windows (WPF) desktop messaging client made by me, for me. My contacts are currently spread across Facebook Messenger and Telegram, requiring me to have more than one website/app open to talk. Compared to the mid-2000s, this is a regression.

:)

I would like

- A tabbed buddy list - "Favourites", then tabs for each service.
- Chat windows, one window per contact at first.
- No chat bubbles - waste of space.

## Using

[TDLib](https://github.com/tdlib/td#using-dotnet) for Telegram.

[FBChat Sharp](https://github.com/gave92/fbchat-sharp) for Facebook.
